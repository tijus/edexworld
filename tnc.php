<h2>Home / Group Tuitions:</h2>
<p>
Edexworld uses strategic tutoring through qualified and educated tutors in the subject matter to help a child not only to improve his or her grades on assignments and tests but also to teach him or her how to master the skills necessary to learn the subject on his or her own. We also have tutors for assignment based tutoring giving assistance on specific assignments given by their teacher as class work or homework. 
</p>
<p>
Our goal of private tutoring for <strong>remedial purposes</strong> is to teach the student ‘how to learn’ the subject for which they are being tutored so that ultimately they no longer needs the assistance of the tutor. Although the time required for each student to understand the learning principles and skills necessary to have an authority on the subject varies individually. Results from strategic tutoring can be expected within 8 to 10 weeks of individualized one-on-one tutoring sessions occurring at least one hour per week during that time frame.
</p>
<p>
We work one-on-one with your child to design a strategic, customized educational plan unique to your child’s needs and learning style so that your child may get the tutor’s full talent and attention. To be successful the child must attend his school and tutoring sessions regularly.
</p>
<p>
So, first confirm that your child will be tutored one-on-one with an individualized curriculum specifically designed for him/her (based on his/her particular needs and learning style) by an educated, trained tutor; whether he will be tutored in small group setting with a pre-established curriculum or he/she needs <strong>assignment based tutor</strong>. 
</p>
<h2>Fees:</h2>
<p>
Our fee pattern for one-on-one tutoring ranges from Rs. 200/- to 350/- per hour and group (home) is competitively prized at Rs. 600/- to Rs. 1050/- per hour of private tutoring.
</p>
<p>
Our fees vary depending on the tutoring style / area. We prefer half / yearly advance payment of fees. Alternatively we invoice for the month in advance prior to when your tutoring session starts and payment is due by the 10th day of each month. If we don’t receive payment by the due day a 20% of the outstanding fees applies as late fee, and tutoring will be suspended until payment is received. Payments can be made by a personal cheque. If the cheque doesn’t clear there is an automatic charge of Rs. 500/- There is a onetime Rs. 1500/- administration fee. There are no surprise fees. A tutoring session may be cancelled at any time with at least 24 hours prior notice. If you don’t cancel a tutoring session as such you will be charged the full one hour fee for the day. If we do receive proper notification, you will be receiving credit for one session one hour to be applied to the next month’s bill. Credits will be reflected on the next month’s billing cycle.  
</p>
